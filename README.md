# Aortic Valve Treatment Decision Support Tool


**Live App**: [https://tavr-savr-decision-support.streamlit.app/)

This is an interactive clinical decision support tool designed to help visualize and compare the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) for patients undergoing either **Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)** or **Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR)**.

<br>

## üîç Purpose of This Project 

Making informed decisions between **Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)** and **Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR)** is complex and highly individualized. While national guidelines and static decision aids exist, they often provide population-level guidance that lacks personalization and transparency.


This project was built to address the gap by:

- Simulate an individual patient profile
- Visualize that patient‚Äôs similarity to past cases
- Compare predicted outcomes under both treatments
- Understand which baseline characteristics drive risk
- Receive a model-guided treatment recommendation (not a decision)

<br>

## üìä Data Description

- **Source**: Real-world, de-identified clinical data collected from the **Northern New England region**
- **Timeframe**: 2015‚Äì2023
- **Patients**: >5,000 individuals treated for aortic valve disease
- **Inclusion**:
  - First-time valve procedures only
  - Elective and urgent cases
  - No missing data (complete-case analysis only)

The dataset includes over 20 baseline clinical features and outcomes used to train predictive models and estimate individualized treatment effects.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers

> ‚ùó This tool is **not** a diagnostic device, nor is it intended to replace clinical judgment.

- It is for **educational, exploratory, and decision-support purposes only**
- Risk estimates are based on patterns observed in historical data from a specific geographic region
- These predictions **may not generalize** to other populations or clinical settings
- Always consult a healthcare professional before making medical decisions
